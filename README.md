# Title: Password Strength Analysis Tool

## Objective:
To analyze password strength using entropy-based models and demonstrate
resistance against brute-force and dictionary attacks.

##Tools:
- Kali Linux
- Python 3
- zxcvbn library

##Methodology:
User-provided and predefined passwords are analyzed using zxcvbn.
The tool evaluates patterns, entropy, and estimates crack time.

##Security Concepts:
- Authentication security
- Brute-force attacks
- Dictionary attacks
- Human factors in security

##Limitations:
- Estimates only, not real cracking
- Offline model assumptions
- No hash algorithm comparison

##Conclusion:
Strong passwords depend on unpredictability, not visible complexity.
